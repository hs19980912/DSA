There is a N×N grid with some water cells that can't be crossed, and movement is restricted to the four directions, up, down, left and right.
A mouse is trying to get from its starting position S to a piece of cheese at T, but there’s a cat at position C. The goal is to find a path from S to T where the shortest distance to the cat C along the path is as large as possible. Use Manhattan distance to measure how close the mouse gets to the cat.
