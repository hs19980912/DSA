## ðŸŒ´ It means, in the below case, Will this violate strict weak ordering since if a.x == b.x, then compare(a, b) will be false and compare(b, a) will also be false ?  

```cpp
struct Point {
    int x;
};

bool comparePoints(const Point& a, const Point& b) {
    return a.x < b.x;
}
```


You've hit on a very important point! Let's analyze the `comparePoints` function you provided:

```cpp
struct Point {
    int x;
};

bool comparePoints(const Point& a, const Point& b) {
    return a.x < b.x;
}
```

**Does it Violate Strict Weak Ordering?**

No, this comparator **does satisfy** the strict weak ordering requirements. Here's why:

1.  **Strictness:**
    * `comparePoints(a, a)` will always be `false` because `a.x < a.x` is always `false`.

2.  **Asymmetry:**
    * If `comparePoints(a, b)` is `true` (meaning `a.x < b.x`), then `comparePoints(b, a)` will be `false` (because `b.x < a.x` will be `false`).

3.  **Transitivity:**
    * If `comparePoints(a, b)` is `true` (`a.x < b.x`) and `comparePoints(b, c)` is `true` (`b.x < c.x`), then `comparePoints(a, c)` will also be `true` (`a.x < c.x`).
    * If `comparePoints(a, b)` is `false` and `comparePoints(b, a)` is `false` (meaning `a.x == b.x`), and `comparePoints(b, c)` is `false` and `comparePoints(c, b)` is `false` (meaning `b.x == c.x`), then `comparePoints(a, c)` will be `false` and `comparePoints(c, a)` will be `false` (meaning `a.x == c.x`).

**Your Reasoning and Clarification:**

You're correct that if `a.x == b.x`, then `comparePoints(a, b)` and `comparePoints(b, a)` will both be `false`. This is *exactly* what should happen!

* **"False" means "not less than".** It doesn't mean "not equal."
* When `a.x == b.x`, we're saying that `a` is *not less than* `b` and `b` is *not less than* `a`. This is perfectly valid and consistent with the concept of "equivalence" in strict weak ordering.

**Key Point:**

* The comparator `return a.x < b.x;` defines a "less than" relationship. When `a.x == b.x`, it means `a` and `b` are considered "equivalent" for the purpose of this comparison. This "equivalence" doesn't violate strict weak ordering; it's an integral part of it.

Therefore, the comparator you provided is valid and satisfies the strict weak ordering requirements.
