## Step-by-Step Counting Process

We'll execute the algorithm to count elements ≤ 41:

```python
def count_less_or_equal(matrix, mid=41):
    count = 0
    n = len(matrix)  # n = 10
    j = n - 1        # j = 9 (start from rightmost column)
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Move left while current element > mid
        while j >= 0 and matrix[i][j] > mid:
            j -= 1
            
        # Count elements in this row that are <= mid
        count += (j + 1)
    
    return count
```

### Row 0 Processing
- Start with i=0, j=9
- Check matrix[0][9] = 60 > 41, so move left: j=8
- Check matrix[0][8] = 47 > 41, so move left: j=7
- Check matrix[0][7] = 33 ≤ 41, so we stop moving left
- Count elements in row 0 that are ≤ 41: j+1 = 7+1 = 8 elements
- Current count = 8

### Row 1 Processing
- Move to row 1, keep j=7
- Check matrix[1][7] = 35 ≤ 41, so we don't need to move left
- Count elements in row 1 that are ≤ 41: j+1 = 7+1 = 8 elements
- Current count = 8 + 8 = 16

### Row 2 Processing
- Move to row 2, keep j=7
- Check matrix[2][7] = 38 ≤ 41, so we don't need to move left
- Count elements in row 2 that are ≤ 41: j+1 = 7+1 = 8 elements
- Current count = 16 + 8 = 24

### Row 3 Processing
- Move to row 3, keep j=7
- Check matrix[3][7] = 44 > 41, so move left: j=6
- Check matrix[3][6] = 39 ≤ 41, so we stop moving left
- Count elements in row 3 that are ≤ 41: j+1 = 6+1 = 7 elements
- Current count = 24 + 7 = 31

### Row 4 Processing
- Move to row 4, keep j=6
- Check matrix[4][6] = 46 > 41, so move left: j=5
- Check matrix[4][5] = 41 ≤ 41, so we stop moving left
- Count elements in row 4 that are ≤ 41: j+1 = 5+1 = 6 elements
- Current count = 31 + 6 = 37

### Row 5 Processing
- Move to row 5, keep j=5
- Check matrix[5][5] = 56 > 41, so move left: j=4
- Check matrix[5][4] = 48 > 41, so move left: j=3
- Check matrix[5][3] = 42 > 41, so move left: j=2
- Check matrix[5][2] = 37 ≤ 41, so we stop moving left
- Count elements in row 5 that are ≤ 41: j+1 = 2+1 = 3 elements
- Current count = 37 + 3 = 40

### Row 6 Processing
- Move to row 6, keep j=2
- Check matrix[6][2] = 50 > 41, so move left: j=1
- Check matrix[6][1] = 43 > 41, so move left: j=0
- Check matrix[6][0] = 40 ≤ 41, so we stop moving left
- Count elements in row 6 that are ≤ 41: j+1 = 0+1 = 1 element
- Current count = 40 + 1 = 41

### Row 7 Processing
- Move to row 7, keep j=0
- Check matrix[7][0] = 45 > 41, so move left: j=-1
- Since j < 0, we're out of bounds, meaning no elements in this row are ≤ 41
- Count elements in row 7 that are ≤ 41: j+1 = -1+1 = 0 elements
- Current count = 41 + 0 = 41

### Row 8 Processing
- Move to row 8, keep j=-1
- Since j < 0, we're out of bounds, no elements in this row are ≤ 41
- Count elements in row 8 that are ≤ 41: j+1 = -1+1 = 0 elements
- Current count = 41 + 0 = 41

### Row 9 Processing
- Move to row 9, keep j=-1
- Since j < 0, we're out of bounds, no elements in this row are ≤ 41
- Count elements in row 9 that are ≤ 41: j+1 = -1+1 = 0 elements
- Current count = 41 + 0 = 41
