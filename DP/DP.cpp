1. Longest Arithmetic Progression.
	Given an array called A[] of sorted integers having no duplicates, find the length of the Longest Arithmetic Progression (LLAP) in it.

	Example 1:

	Input:
	N = 6
	set[] = {1, 7, 10, 13, 14, 19}
	Output: 4
	Explanation: The longest arithmetic 
	progression is {1, 7, 13, 19}.
	Example 2:

	Input:
	N = 5
	A[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
	Output: 5
	Explanation: The whole set is in AP.
